Deep Learning for Physics Research is a book for physics students who want an introduction to modern machine learning techniques for their research. Each chapter is followed by several exercises with solutions which can be found at [www.deeplearningphysics.org](https://deeplearningforphysicsresearchbook.github.io/deep-learning-physics/). 
Here we again go through all these exercises, but probably in a different way. On the one hand they will be solved in Python in the Pytorch ecosystem, but we will also solve them in Julia. Maybe in the future we will also take a look into the JAX ecosystem.
